The <a href=https://betterexplained.com/articles/the-rule-of-72/> Rule of 72</a> is a useful shortcut to determine the approximate time required to double one's investment. By this rule, It takes roughly <code>72/r</code> years to double your principal/investment, where <code>r</code> is the annual rate of compounding interest. So, with <code>12% p.a.</code> interest rate (compounded annually), you can double your investment in 6 (<code>72/12</code>) years. The rule can also be used to calculate the rate of interest required to double a sum of money in <code>y</code> years (<code>r = 72/y</code>).
</p>
<p>
This is a useful rule. But, a general rule of thumb that estimates the time required to convert an amount <code>P</code> into <code>X*P</code> would be better. In this article you will learn that.
</p>

<h3> Problem </h3>
<p>
Say I want to convert <code>50,000 $</code> to <code>1,000,000 $</code> at <code>8 % p.a.</code> How many years will that take?
Our goal here is to be able to solve this problem in our head (easily).
</p>

<h3> Possible Solutions </h3>

<h4> Use Rule of 72 to get a vague estimate </h4>

<p><code>1,000,000</code> is <code>20</code> times <code>50,000</code>.</p>
<p>
We know that the amount will double in <code>72/8=9</code> years. At the end of <code>9</code> years, the amount is <code>100,000</code>. Crossing <code>18 (2*9)</code> years it becomes <code>200,000 = 2<sup>2</sup> * (50,000)</code>. After <code>27 (3*9)</code> years, it becomes <code>400,000 = 2<sup>3</sup> * (50,000)</code>. Notice the pattern that after n*9 years the total amount is <code>2<sup>n</sup> * (50,000)</code>. We know that <code>20</code> lies between <code>2<sup>4</sup> (16)</code> and <code>2<sup>5</sup> (32)</code>. In <code>9*4</code> years our amount grows to <code>800,000 (16*50,000)</code> and  in <code>9*5</code> years our amount grows to <code>1,600,000 (32*50,000)</code>. <code>1,00,000</code> falls in between <code>800,000</code> and <code>1,600,000</code>. So the time it takes to get a million dollars will be anywhere between <code>36 (9**4)</code> and <code>45 (9**5)</code> years. To get a more accurate time we can use simple interest calculation. Thge simple interest for <code>800,000</code> is <code>64,000 (0.08 * 800,000) </code>. Thrice the Simple Interest is approximately <code>200,000</code> (<code>196,000</code> exactly).Compound interest for this three years will be more than Simple Interest as the interest earns interest in compounding. So we get a million in <code>36+3</code> years. The exact value after <code>39</code> years is <code>1,005,764.88</code> (which you can calculate <a href="https://financialmentor.com/calculator/compound-interest-calculator"> here </a>). We need to be careful that this small difference of <code>5764.88 $</code>(<code>1,005,764.88-1,00,000</code>) will grow to a large amount when compounding for more years. The problem with this approach is that the estimated <code>36-45</code> has a range/gap of <code>11</code> years. This gap widens as the rate of interest gets smaller. We need a better solution that can reduce this range/gap.
</p>
<h3> A clever solution </h3>
<p>
Just as we have a rule to double our money, we also have a rule to triple our money. It takes <code>110/r</code> years to triple. To make our money <code>4</code> times initial, it takes <code>139/r</code> years. To make it <code>5</code> times it takes <code>161/r</code> years and so on ... to make it <code>20</code> times it takes <code>300/r</code> years. We need to remember 20 rules to be able to estimate the number of years for multiplying our principal for up to 20 times. To calculate for a multiple of up to 100 times, we should remember 100 such  rules. Remembering so many numbers is a challenge for many. Luckily, there is a neat mathematical trick that eases the load on our memory.
</p>
  <p>We all have learnt in school that any number can be written as a product of just prime numbers. Yes, it is true. It is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">Fundamental theorem of Arithmetic</a>. Take out a paper and work it out. For example <code>20=2<sup>2</sup>*5</code>, <code>53=53</code> (it is a prime number), <code>45=3<sup>3</sup>*5</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are rules for the first 14 prime numbers.
    <div>
      <table class="table table-bordered text-center">
        <thead>
          <tr><th>#</th><th>Multiplicative factor (<code>X</code> mentioned above)</th><th>Rule (<code>r</code> is the rate of interest)</th></tr>
    </thead>

So here is how we use the above knowledge here:</br>
<ol>
  <li>Represent the multiplier <code>X</code> (<code>20</code> in our problem) as a product of its primes.</br><code>20=2<sup>2</sup>*5=2<sup>2</sup>*5<sup>1<sup></code>.</li>
<li>The prime factors of <code>X</code> will be of the form <code>prime<sup>n</sup></code>. Using the table above apply the corresponding rule and find the number of years, <code>y</code>. Multiply <code>y</code> with <code>n</code>.</li>
<li>Repeat step 2. for all the prime factors.</li>
<li>Sum up all the years from above. This is the result we need.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Now, lets apply the steps to our problem.
<ol>
  <li>The desired/final amount (<code>1,000,000</code>) is <code>20</code> times the initial/principal amount (<code>50,000</code>).<code>20=2<sup>2</sup>*5<sup>1</sup></code>.</li>
<li> For factor <code>2<sup>2</sup></code>, we apply <strong>Rule of 72</strong>, and multiply the result by <code>2</code>. <code>72/8=9</code> and <code>9*2=18</code> years.</li>
  <li> We repeat it for <code>5<sup>1</sup></code>.For factor <code>5<sup>1</sup></code>, we apply <strong>Rule of 240</strong>, and multiply the result by <code>1</code>.<code>161/8=20</code> (approx) and <code>20*1=20</code> years.</li>
<li> So our answer is <code>18+20=38</code> years.The accurate answer is a touch above <code>37.5</code> years.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
I prefer to look at the above procedure this way:
</br>
<code>Multiplier, X=(prime1)<sup>a</sup> * (prime2)<sup>b</sup> * (prime3)<sup>c</sup> * (prime4)<sup>d</sup> * ...</code>
</br>
becomes
</br>
<code>Required years, Y=(<strong>Rule for prime1</strong>) * a + (<strong>Rule for prime2</strong>) * b +(<strong>Rule for prime3</strong>) * c + (<strong>Rule for prime4</strong>) * d + ...</code>
</br>
</p>
<h3> The faster solution </h3>
<p>
The above solution is quite accurate, then there is the problem of remembering 15 rules for multipliers till 50. We can forego a bit of accuracy by using an approximation trick. The trick is to approximate the multiplier (<code>X</code>) using a small set of prime factors rather than all. We will try to approximate any <code>X</code> as a product of prime factors <code>2,3,5,</code> and <code>7</code>. 53 as approximately 56(<code>2<sup>3</sup><sub>*</sub>7=56</code>),  29 as 30(<code>2<sup>1</sup><sub>*</sub>3<sup>1</sup><sub>*</sub>5<sup>1</sup>=30</code>) and so on.
Now we need to remember only 4 rules (<strong> Rule of 72, Rule of 110, Rule of 161</strong> and <strong>Rule of 195</strong>) to get a good approximation.
</p>
<p>
  Lets quickly work through another problem using this method.
</br>
<b>Problem:</b> Years to make <code>2,650,000 $</code> from <code>50,000 $</code> at <code>6 % p.a.</code> compounded annually.
</br>
<b>Solution:</b>
<p>
 <code>2,650,000 $</code> is <code>53 (2,650,000/50,000=53)</code> times <code>50,000 $</code>.
 Taking 53 as approximately 56 results in <code>56=2<sup>3</sup><sub>*</sub>7</code>.
 Required years, <code>Y=(<strong>Rule of 72</strong>) * 3 + (<strong>Rule of 195</strong>) * 1</code>.<code>Y=(72/6) * 3 + (195/6) * 1=12*3 + 32.5*1 = 68.5</code>.
